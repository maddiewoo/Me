		<p> After rolling out of bed, you go and collect the mail. Out of the usual mail you always get, there is a very large and very colorful envelope. <br> </br> Staring at it for a while, you decide it is safe to open and the envelope explodes open littering the hallway in airplane tickets. Confusion is your first reaction and you take a look at the papers left inside. The first paper you pull out says</p>

		<p class= "dialogue"> <em>"Congratulations, you have been selected as one of the few people to compete to attempt to win as much money as you will need to live luxuriously for the rest of your life. If you choose to be a competitor in this once in a lifetime opportunity, you must follow these rules. To win, you must first travel to the location disclosed on a paper in this packet. Also enclosed in this packet are first class plane tickets to any place in the world. "</em> </p>
