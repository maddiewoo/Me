		<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
		<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the basic skeleton of the internet. At it's simplest form, like this website, it looks <strong><em>incredibly</em></strong> boring. But if the basic HTML structure didn't exist, there would be no websites at all.</p>
		<p>HTML is a language written in and between tags that look like this:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;NAME OF THE TAG GOES HERE&gt;</code></p>
		<p>Each tag, once opened, must be closed, because the browser interprets <em>within</em> the tags--if you don't close a tag like this:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;/NAME OF THE TAG GOES HERE&gt;</code></p>
		<p>It will continue interpreting the meaning of the tag for all the code beneath it.</p>
		<p>Every tag has a different meaning. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, for instance, denotes the opening and closing of a paragraph.</p>
		<p>Tags can be nested within each other so that both tags affect the things sandwiched between them. For instance, the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag is used to make things <strong>bold</strong> and the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag is used to make things italicized, but you can put them together like this:</p>
		<p><code>
		<!-- the weird &nbsp; things are just spaces so the code would look like it was tabbed in. html unfortunately doesn't have a native tab tag -->
		&lt;strong&gt;<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR TEXT GOES HERE<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;<br />
		&lt;/strong&gt;</code></p>
		<p>To make things both <strong><em>bold and italicized</em></strong>.</p>
		<p>In its latest incarnation, HTML 5, there is even a tag for inserting videos into your website, like so:</p>
		<video width = "640" height = "480" controls>
			<source src = "maru.mp4" type = "video/mp4">
		</video>
		<p>A list of useful html tags is available <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">here.</a></p>
		<p>Alternatively, you can reach the same link by clicking this ridiculously large button (this is another example of nested tags, with the image getting tag being nested in the hyperlinking one):</p>
